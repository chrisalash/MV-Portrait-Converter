# MV-Portrait-Converter
Before running the program:
Make sure you have the latest version of python installed
Easy way to do so is to download python latest (i recommend from the windows store) and run these 2 commands in the terminal/command prompt
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade Pillow

Steps to run the script:
-------------------------
1.) Make sure the portait template is in the same folder as the program

2.) Place all of the portraits you want to add into the pre_photos. The program will automatically transform all of the portraits put into the folder into RPG Maker format. Put the portraits in as individual files (can get individual images by dragging sprites off pmd portrait repository).

3.) Open up a terminal/command prompt and cd into the folder where the python script is with the following command "cd FILEPATH" (you can obtain the filepath by copying the top line of file explorer) (also don't keep the quotes)

4.) run the command "python mvconvert.py"

5.) Should run as usual! Happy automating!
